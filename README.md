Plays Magic: the Gathering with you!  

This is an application aimed at simulating a game of Magic: the Gathering using object oriented methodologies. 

### To Play
Compile source files and run Main.

### Plans  
I plan on adding more deck types and potentially graphics in the future. This started as a proof of concept but I feel I could take it farther in the future.
